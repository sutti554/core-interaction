            And yet (this was the murky part, this was what bothered me) there had
            also <br />
            been other, way more confusing and fucked-up nights, grappling around
            half- <br />
            dressed, weak light sliding in from the bathroom and everything haloed
            and <br />
            unstable without my glasses: hands on each other, rough and fast,
            kicked- <br />
            over beers foaming on the carpet — fun and not that big of a deal when
            it was <br />
            actually happening, more than worth it for the sharp gasp when my eyes
            rolled <br />
            back and I forgot about everything; but when we woke the next morning
            <br />
            stomach-down and groaning on opposite sides of the bed it receded into
            an <br />
            incoherence of backlit flickers, choppy and poorly lit like some
            experimental <br />
            film, the unfamiliar twist of Boris’s features fading from memory already <br />
            and none of it with any more bearing on our actual lives than a dream. We <br />
            never spoke of it; it wasn’t quite real; getting ready for school we threw shoes, <br />
            splashed water at each other, chewed aspirin for our hangovers, laughed and <br />
            joked around all the way to the bus stop. I knew people would think the wrong <br />
            thing if they knew, I didn’t want anyone to find out and I knew Boris didn’t <br />
            either, but all the same he seemed so completely untroubled by it that I was <br />
            fairly sure it was just a laugh, nothing to take too seriously or get worked up <br />
            about. And yet more than once, I had wondered if I should step up my nerve <br />
            and say something; draw some kind of line, make things clear, just to make <br />
            absolutely sure he didn’t have the wrong idea. But the moment had never come.
