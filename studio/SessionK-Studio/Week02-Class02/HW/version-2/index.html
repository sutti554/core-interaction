            within the buildings’ wings, lay out the entrances, the gardens, courtyards, roofs, and terraces: shape both the volume of the buildings and the volume of the space between the buildings at the same time—remembering that indoor space and outdoor space, yin and yang, must always get their shape together; when the major parts of buildings and the outdoor areas have been given their rough shape, it is the right time to give more detailed attention to the paths and squares between the buildings; now, with the paths fixed, we come back to the buildings: within the various wings of any one building, work out the fundamental gradients of space, and decide how the movement will connect the spaces in the gradients; within the framework of the wings and their internal gradients of space and movement, define the most important areas and rooms. First, for a house; then the same for offices, workshops, and public buildings; add those small outbuildings which must be slightly independent from the main structure, and put in the access from the upper stories to the street and gardens; prepare to knit the inside of the building to the outside, by treating the edge between the two as a place in its own right, and making human details there; decide on the arrangement of the gardens, and the places in the gardens;
            go back to the inside of the building and attach the necessary minor rooms and alcoves to complete the main rooms; fine tune the shape and size of rooms and alcoves to make them precise and buildable; give all the walls some depth, wherever there are to be alcoves, windows, shelves, closets, or seats;
