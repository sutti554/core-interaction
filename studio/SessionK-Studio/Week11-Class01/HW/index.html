          And yet (this was the murky part, this was what bothered me) there had
          also <br />
          been other, way more confusing and fucked-up nights, grappling around
          half- <br />
          dressed, weak light sliding in from the bathroom and everything haloed
          and <br />
          unstable without my glasses: hands on each other, rough and fast,
          kicked- <br />
          over beers foaming on the carpet — fun and not that big of a deal when
          it was <br />
          actually happening, more than worth it for the sharp gasp when my eyes
          rolled <br />
          back and I forgot about everything; but when we woke the next morning
          <br />
          stomach-down and groaning on opposite sides of the bed it receded into
          an <br />
          incoherence of backlit flickers, choppy and poorly lit like some
          experimental <br />
          film, the unfamiliar twist of Boris’s features

          our hangovers, laughed and <br />
          joked around all the way to the bus stop. I knew people would think
          the wrong <br />
          thing if they knew, I didn’t want anyone to find out and I knew Boris
          didn’t <br />
          either, but all the same he seemed so completely untroubled by it that
          I was <br />
          fairly sure it was just a laugh, nothing to take too seriously or get
          worked up <br />
          about. And yet more than once, I had wondered if I should step up
        </mark>
        <button id="nerve">my nerve</button> <br /><!--

          and say something; draw some kind of line, make things clear, just to
          make <br />
          absolutely sure he didn’t have the wrong idea. But the moment had
          never come.
