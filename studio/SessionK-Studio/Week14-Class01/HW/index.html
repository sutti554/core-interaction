                And yet (this was the murky part, this was what <span class="highlight">bothered me</span>) there had
                also
                <br />
                been other, way more <span class="highlight">confusing</span> and fucked-up nights, grappling around
                half- <br />
                dressed, weak light sliding in from the bathroom and everything
                <span class="poem">haloed</span> and <br />
                unstable without my glasses: hands on each other, rough and fast,
                kicked- <br />
                over beers foaming on the carpet — fun and <span class="highlight">not that big of a deal</span> when
                it was <br />
                actually happening, more than worth it for the sharp gasp when my eyes
                rolled <br />
                back and I forgot about everything; but when we woke the next
                <span class="poem">morning</span> <br />
                stomach-down and groaning on opposite sides of the bed it receded into
                an <br />

            <div id="parttwo">
                incoherence of
                <span class="poem">backlit</span> flickers, choppy and poorly lit like some experimental <br />
                film, the unfamiliar twist of Boris’s
                <span class="poem">features</span> fading from memory already <br />
                and none of it with any more <span class="highlight">bearing</span> on our <span
                    class="highlight">actual
                    lives</span> than a dream. We <br />
                never spoke of it; it <span class="highlight">wasn’t quite real</span>; getting ready for school we
                threw
                shoes, <br />
                splashed water at each other, chewed aspirin for our hangovers, laughed and <br />
                joked around all the way to the bus stop. I knew people would think the <span
                    class="highlight">wrong</span>
                <br />
            </div>
            <div id="partthree">
                thing if they knew, I didn’t want anyone to <span class="highlight">find out</span> and I knew Boris
                didn’t
                <br />
                either, but all the same he seemed so completely
                <span class="poem">untroubled</span> by it that I was <br />
                fairly sure it was <span class="highlight">just a laugh</span>, nothing to take <span
                    class="highlight">too
                    seriously</span> or get <span class="highlight">worked
                    up</span> <br />
                about. And yet more than once, I had wondered if I should step up my nerve <br />
                and say something; draw some kind of line, make things clear, just to make <br />
                absolutely sure he didn’t have the <span class="highlight">wrong idea</span>. But the
                <span class="poem">moment</span> had never come.
